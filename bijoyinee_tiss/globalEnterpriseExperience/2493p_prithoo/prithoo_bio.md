## About Me

Hello, everyone. I am Prithoo, a denizen from the state of Assam in the north-east region of India. I am currently working as a corporate employee.

## What I can Offer

Since childhood, I have had multiple hobbies that I personally endeavoured to develop into skills and as time went on, I became quite proficent in those areas.

Personally, I like to wear many hats and as such, I can put forward my skills in graphic design, creative and communicative writing and copy-editing.

## Goal for this Endeavour

My primary goal in joining this programme is to find ways and solutions to end modern-day slavery. 

As some of us are aware, the number of slaves currently right now in the world is the highest in recorded history.[^1][^2] A significant number of these slaves are not even in visible types of slavery and are incorporated into hidden slavery and also indenture.[^3][^4][^5] The Indian diaspora is a major victim of these types of asocial practices[^5][^6] and growing up, listening to anecdotal records and observations, I find the lack of action and concern from all circles of society and government about this hideous issue apalling.

As such, I hope that in this programme, I may at least start a conversation about this subject so that at least awareness is raised. After all, 

"_The first step in solving a problem is recognizing there is one._"
