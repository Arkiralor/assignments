# Gramophone


## Overview
Gramophone is a end-to-end, data-driven support network for farmers. It was founded in 2016, with an initial goal of _helping_ farmers. In the initial phases, it simply provided a cloud-market for farmers but has now expanded to multiple roles in the agricultural sector, focusing on prividing agricultural workers with any and all feasible assistance that they can.

Currently, they provide the following services, as described on their masthead:

1. __Gram Salah:__ _Real-time Solutions by Our Agronomy Experts for Farmers_
    
    This service provides the farmer with real time updates about the current weather patterns, agronomic recommendations and _mandi_ prices.
2. __Gram Bazar:__ _Get All Agri-Input Products of Top Brands with Gram Bazaar_

    This service provides the farmers with a cloud-market, populated with the best brands, providing all sorts of agricultural products and services that one may need.
3. __Gram Vyapar:__ _Buy & Sell Crops to anyone from anywhere in India_

    This service allows the farmer to buy/sell their produce to anyone, through the use of a specialised cloud market; like Amazon, but for farmers, specifically.
4. __Gram Sabha:__ _A Social network of 5 Lac+ Farmers and Agri-experts_

    This service is a social-media network, specifically catered to agri-workers, allowing them to collaborate and network with each other to come up with their own community-based solutions to problems they may face and to expand their own knowledge-base through the use of _peer-to-peer_ exchanges.
5. __Super Fasal:__ _Save your Soil for Long Run with Super Fasal Program_

    This service provides the agri-workers with in-depth reports about the soil and its composition in their farms, allowing them to better prepare and plan for upcoming planting and harvesting sessions. This allows the farmer to preserve the nutritional content of the farm as well as to prolong the usage of the farm, mitigating the usage of fallow seasons for nutrient replenishment.

## Problem Statement

One of the most pressing problems that plague indian agri-workers is the lack of resources and intel that most commercial and industrial agricultural firms have access to. 
This means that most farmers here, most of whom are independent, cottage-industry-scale producers face an even harder time to balance the economies of scale and quality for their produce.
