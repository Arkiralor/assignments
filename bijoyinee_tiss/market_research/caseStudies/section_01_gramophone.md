"We are on a Mission to transform the Agriculture in India"

## Overview
Gramophone is an end-to-end, data-driven support network for farmers. It was founded in 2016, with the initial goal of _helping_ farmers. In the initial phases, it simply provided a cloud market for farmers but has now expanded to multiple roles in the agricultural sector, focusing on providing agricultural workers with any and all feasible assistance that they can.

## Problem Statement

One of the most pressing problems that plague Indian agri-workers is the lack of resources and intel that most commercial and industrial agricultural firms have access to. 
This means that most farmers here, most of whom are independent, cottage-industry-scale producers face an even harder time balancing the economies of scale and quality of their produce.

For a country that is still largely agrarian-based and which aims to be completely self-sufficient in the case of food production, this serves as a severe handicap to the production of produce, especially as the population keeps increasing and faming needs to become more intensive to keep up with the demand.

This not only to the soil, with its nutrient level decreasing every cycle...but also pressures the farmer into taking steps that may not be suitable to them in the long term.

## Solutions Offered

Gramaphone offered a solution to the issue by not just offering generic farming intel and resources, but by collating and using data, provided by individual farmers, to provide each and every farm with _custom_ intelligence and advice.

They use the data and information provided by the farmers themselves to tailor the assistance provided to suit the individual use cases for each participating farm.

Currently, they provide the following services, as described on their masthead:

1. __Gram Salah:__ _Real-time Solutions by Our Agronomy Experts for Farmers_
    
    This service provides the farmer with real-time updates about the current weather patterns, agronomic recommendations and _mandi_ prices.
2. __Gram Bazar:__ _Get All Agri-Input Products of Top Brands with Gram Bazaar_

    This service provides the farmers with a cloud market, populated with the best brands, providing all sorts of agricultural products and services that one may need.
3. __Gram Vyapar:__ _Buy & Sell Crops to anyone from anywhere in India_

    This service allows the farmer to buy/sell their produce to anyone, through the use of a specialised cloud market; like Amazon, but for farmers, specifically.
4. __Gram Sabha:__ _A Social network of 5 Lac+ Farmers and Agri-experts_

    This service is a social-media network, specifically catered to agri-workers, allowing them to collaborate and network with each other to come up with their own community-based solutions to problems they may face and to expand their own knowledge base through the use of _peer-to-peer_ exchanges.
5. __Super Fasal:__ _Save your Soil for Long Run with Super Fasal Program_

    This service provides agri-workers with in-depth reports about the soil and its composition in their farms, allowing them to better prepare and plan for upcoming planting and harvesting sessions. This allows the farmer to preserve the nutritional content of the farm as well as to prolong the usage of the farm, mitigating the usage of fallow seasons for nutrient replenishment.

## Results Obtained

1. Since its founding in 2016, over 2 million farmers have joined the platform spread across 50'000 villages, with 67% of all participants being repeat clients.[^1]
2. Gramophone has connected a total of 4'000 listed buyers to the farmers on its network, and the platform currently sits at 500'000 orders served and 40'000 total listings across its various services. [^2]
3. Currently it has facilitated over 6'000 micro-entrepreneurs to launch their initiatives. [^2]
4. Gramophone has so far generated over Rs. 100'000'000 in income for its participants. [^3]
5. They have performed over 10'000 soil tests, with over 430'000 acres of active farmland affected by their proposed organic and sustainable farming practices. [^3]

## Afterword and Possible Future Scope

Overall, Gramophone provides a much-needed platform for Indian farmers to compete with modern agricultural industries while maintaining sustainable practices to ensure a recurring production of produce.

Based on the facts and figures published by the organisation, it can be said that their approach is not only pragmatic to the market they target but is also providing dividends to stakeholders as they have an astounding 67% rate for recurring clients.

One statistic that we couldn't find on their impact report was however, the mean/median income of the participating farmers, as that would have played a major role in determining the future scope of their work on our end.

A few suggestions for future scope, disregarding that key metric would be:

1. Incorporate farms and agri-workers from neighbouring nations/regions as well.
2. Assimilate people and stakeholders from different circles and steps of the agri-ecosphere to provide more options to participants in terms of resources and avenues.
3. Expand to and collaborate with agricultural universities to provide a two-way exchange of information and expertise and to further promote grassroots collaboration between the two parties.
