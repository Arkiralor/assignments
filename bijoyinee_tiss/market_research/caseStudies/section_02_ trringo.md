_Ab Tractor Call Karo..._

## Overview

Trringo, founded in 2016, is a first-of-its-kind farm-equipment rental company in India, backed by Mahindra India. It aims to increase the mechanisation of the indiam agri-sector by providing, primarilly tractors/tractor-attachments and other equipment on a flexible, rental basis.

## Problem Statement

"_In our country where farm mechanization penetration is low, Mahindra would like to play a significant role in enabling our farmers to improve their productivity and Rise by providing accessible technology. The TRRINGO farm equipment rental business model will enable farmers to deploy mechanization technology on a pay per use basis without investing in the asset. This will increase their output and prosperity and lead to the inclusive growth of the
nation._"

\- __Dr. Pawan Goenka, Executive Director, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd__[^1]

Farming equipment is costly. Even in countries/regions with substantially higher standards of living and/or household income, farming equipment signifies a significant investment from the agri-worker. Add to that that India is a low-middle income country with most farmers having a monthly income of less than the national median income.[^2] This poses a critical challenge in the agri-sphere where essential equipment may be beyond the capabilities of regular farmer to buy outright.

This creates a viscious cycle where one would need to possess proper equipment to increase their production per unit of currency/time spent, but lacks the finances which require them to increase their production per unit of currency/time spent. I am sure the reader can see how this would pose a problem.

Although farm-equipment rental existed in India since the advent of industrilized farming, most of it was conducted through grey-channels and hard saw any legislative oversight, leading to many instances of exploitation of small and medium scale farmers. This led many to forgo proper mechanization of their farms, essentially still following practices and using equipment dateing back to the medieval era.

## Solutions Offered

Trringo aims to solve this problem by providing farming equipment on a rental basis, mitigating the need to buy the equiopment outright. This would help the agri-workers to gain access to paraphenalia that they require without having to divulge the monetary cost of outright ownership.

This would also help in providing access to more famers with fewer equipment as the rental system would work on a rotational basis and agri-workers would only need to rent and pay for the equipment for the suration that they would require it; leading to lower greenhouse emissions and higher yeild for the farms, at the same time.

And since Trringo is an incorporated company with dedicated teams for handling grievances, finances and all related information as demanded under the law of the Republic of India, there is significant regulatory oversight on their services, which has led to farmers being able to gain access to the equipment without resorting to grey-channels. This has led to a significant decrease in exploitation and various other sub-par treatment that they were previously susceptible to.

### Services Offered

1. Farmers who need a particular service place an order by calling or using the Trringo app, which sends the equipment with a trained operator. The app has features like direct booking, browsing new implements in their area, booking for other farmers in the community, and managing multiple farm lands.[^3]

2. Fully trained support staff with proper maintanence of all farming and _ready-to-rent_ equipment.[^3]


## Results Obtained

1. 60% increase in farm-flow in Q1-2018.[^4]
2. Farming equipment available to rent in over 1'000 villages, as of Jan 16<sup>th</sup>, 2018.[^5]
3. Over 100'000 work-hours logged for farm-equipment on a rental basis.[^5]
4. Currently (Apr 18<sup>th</sup>, 2024) ranked as the #1 service for farm-equipment rentals in India.[^6]


## Afterword and Possible Future Scope

It cannot be understated, just how much of an impact a simple concept as _renting_ a tractor has had on the india farming landscape. Something which was out of reach for the majority of indian agri-workers is now a feasible option for them. This has led to significant increases in the yeild of farms and hence the income of the participating farmers.

That being said, for future scope, these would be the key take-away points that we would like to suggest.

1. Expand on avenues of contact for the agri-workers.
2. Increase the size of teams available for support and technical roles as this is an IT-First platform.
3. Provide training session for the agri-workers on safe and efficient handling of farm-equipment; this is not something they currently provide as we could not find any mention of it in any piece of publication related to Trringo.
