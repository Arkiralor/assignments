# Ninjacart

_Building better lives for every agri citizen_

## Overview

Ninjacart is a B2B and B2C market linkage firm, specialising in connecting prospective vendors and clients with producers (farmers, processors, et cetera). It was founded in 2015, with the aim  of harnessing technology to build commerce, finance and  fulfilment solutions that help build better lives for agricultural worker.[^1]

It not only provides agri-workers with market linkage but also facilitates better decisions in agriculture by providing tools and insights that seek to reduce guesswork from various stages of the agricultural life cycle. 

Ninjacart also invests in startups (pre-series/seed and series-A), with established ventures on both: the national and the international stages.[^2][^3]

## Problem Statement

Producing deliverables like produce, dairy, processed foods like cheese, et cetera is only one part of the problem statement in agriculture; for one to make a living, one would need to actually sell the produced goods and services to interested parties for a fair price, such that both the parties make a profit.

With the most influential vendors clients established in urban or semi-urban areas and most producers located in rural areas, there has been a certain level of logistical _problems_ in establishing contact between the two. Sure, the vendors and clients have agents and offices in rural and remote areas, but considering the sheer number of rural areas in the country and _why_ some place is considered rural/remote in the first place, the problem with connectivity becomes obvious and hence, some, if not most places are found outside of the network of many vendors and clients (henceforth referred simply as 'clients').

## Solutions Offered

Ninjacart aims to mitigate this problem by acting as an intermediary between the producers and the clients. It connects farmers and other producers to prospective clients via its platform in the hopes that both parties will be able to come up with a mutually beneficial trade. It also provides farmers with tools and information that enable them to make the best possible decisions for their situation and has also expanded into financing solutions, as well as global operations.

## Afterword and Possible Future Scope

It can be said that besides all agri-startups, ninjacart is a _jack-of-all-trades_ and is the one most poised to become *the* key player in their niche and indeed, the Indian market.

As they have also started investing in international firms and have started operations in the same; it can also be safely assumed that their business model, though a bit slow to mature, is quickly becoming long-term profitable and is, most importantly stable; something which a lot of startups neglect to enforce.

All in all, Ninjacart seems to be a safe investment for agri-workers and clients alike to divulge their resources to as a _better_ for personal, economic and social growth.
